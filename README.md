# 1# Compiler #

A compiler from a Scheme-like language to the 1# text register machine
language (originally written by Larry Moss:
http://www.indiana.edu/~iulg/trm/index.shtml).

In addition to the compiler, this repo provides a runtime for the 1#
language.

Please excuse the mess as the project is in its early stages.
